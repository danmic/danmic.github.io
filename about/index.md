Engineer by education, researcher by vocation. I am always ready to challenge myself with projects that can have an impact on people's lives. My research interests mostly extend across three areas: machine learning, specifically deep learning; computer vision, especially applied to medical imaging; signal processing, with a particular focus on acoustic signals. Currently, I am using my skills and expertise within the field of medical image analysis at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com) aiming at helping people with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, obesity and haemophilia.

I have a PhD in electrical and electronic engineering, obtained at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk), where I worked within the [Centre for Acoustic Signal Processing Research](http://caspr.es.aau.dk) (CASPR). During my PhD, I successfully collaborated with academic and industrial partners, specifically with Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Spain), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy), [Oticon](https://www.oticon.com) (Denmark) and Tencent AI Lab (USA). My dissertation focused on deep-learning-based audio-visual speech enhancement and it was the basis of my postdoctoral research, which I carried on at Oticon and Aalborg University, with the purpose of investigating cutting-edge technologies for multimodal hearing assistive devices.

Before starting my PhD project, I got a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering at the [University of Perugia](https://www.unipg.it/en/) (Italy), and a Master's in Vision, Graphics and Interactive Systems at Aalborg University, where I worked on several projects, including one on biometrics in collaboration with with [Fingerprint Cards](https://www.fingerprints.com). I have also worked as an intern at [Bang & Olufsen](https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en).
