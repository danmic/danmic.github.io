> Blindness separates people from things; deafness separates people from people.
> - Helen Keller



I am a PhD Fellow at [Aalborg University](https://www.en.aau.dk). I am a part of the [Centre for Acoustic Signal Processing Research](http://caspr.es.aau.dk) (CASPR), supevised by [Zheng-Hua Tan](http://kom.aau.dk/~zt/) and [Jesper Jensen](http://kom.aau.dk/~jje/). My research interests include machine learning, computer vision and signal processing. Currently, I am working on a project regarding audio-visual speech enhancement, hoping that my findings will improve the quality of life in people with a hearing loss.
